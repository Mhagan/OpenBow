OpenSource Nerf Blaster


Improvements over current offerings:
Material: must be inexpensive, durable, low friction and commonly available

Assembly: should not be 'Fiddly'. The assembly instructions should be easy to follow and quantifiable. i.e. they should not include words like 'tweak', 'fiddle', or 'play with it until it is right'

Longevity: Wearing parts are to be limited to Commercial off the shelf COTS items wherever possible. Ideally, 10,000+ cycles is the goal. 

Installation: should be able to be done with only a drill, and hardware

Development Stages:
1)the Catch First -- Prototype ready for testing
2)Grip and trigger -- Brain storming in progress
3)Assembly Jigs
4)Installation and servicing procedures
